	<h1>Welcome to our store.</h1>
	<p>We used to have tons of options, but we've cut most of them due to complexity reasons.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 85%; color: blue">You have two main options available to you. If you're an existing entity/thing/etc., log in using the Sign In button below.</p>

	<form action="../common/login.php">
    	<input type="submit" value="Sign In">
	</form>

	<p>If you haven't yet signed your life over to our evil, soulless corporation, you can register below. </p>
	
	<form action="../customer/register.php">
    	<input type="submit" value="Register">
	</form>
	
	<p>I'm really not sure what else should go on this page. Maybe a search button?
